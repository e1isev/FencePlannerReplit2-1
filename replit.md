## Recent Changes (January 22, 2026)

### Estimate Page Enhancements
- **Renamed "Quote" to "Estimate"**: Updated all user-facing text throughout the application from "Quote" to "Estimate"
- **Customer Details Form**: Added editable fields for customer name, email, and phone number on the estimate page
- **Delivery Address Form**: Added editable fields for delivery address and delivery notes on the estimate page
- **GST-Inclusive Pricing**: Added Unit (ex GST), Unit (inc GST), Total (ex GST), and Total (inc GST) columns to the Products and Services table
- **Updated Totals Section**: Now displays "Subtotal (ex GST)", "GST (10%)", and "Total (inc GST)" for clear pricing breakdown

### Height Filtering by SKU Availability
- **Updated `getSupportedPanelHeights`**: Now filters height options based on actual SKU availability in the pricing catalog
- Heights are only displayed if there's a matching SKU for the selected fence style and color combination
- Uses the bySku map for accurate filtering based on catalog data

### Critical Bug Fix - Project Loading Loop
- **Fixed**: Added `loadedProjectIdRef` guard in `PlannerEntryPage.tsx` to prevent loading the same project repeatedly
- Prevents infinite loading loop when opening saved projects

## Previous Changes (January 21, 2026)

### Critical Bug Fix - Infinite Loop Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The `useProjectAutosave` hook was calling `updateActiveProjectSnapshot` which updated timestamps and triggered a feedback loop with `PlannerEntryPage`
- **Fix Applied**: Added `isUpdatingRef` guard in `useProjectAutosave.ts` to prevent recursive updates when the snapshot update triggers re-renders
- **Result**: Application now renders successfully without "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

### WebGL Fallback
- Added WebGL fallback UI for headless environments where MapLibre GL cannot initialize
- The map displays "Map Not Available" with helpful guidance when WebGL is unavailable

### Professional SKU-Based Pricing System
- **SKU Builder** (`shared/pricing/skuBuilder.ts`): Deterministic SKU generation using templates matching actual catalog patterns
  - Panel SKUs: `Bellbrae-{Colour}-{Height}m`, `Mystique-{Lattice|Solid}-{Colour}-{Height}m`, `Picket-{Style}-{Colour}-{Height}m`
  - Post SKUs: `ResPost-{PostKind}-{Wht|Col}-{Height}m`
  - Gate SKUs: `Gate-{Picket|Myst}-{Single|Double}-{Height}H-{Width}W`, `Gate-{Pick|Myst}-Sliding-{Height}H-{Min}/{Max}`
- **Catalog Validation**: Validates catalog on import for duplicates, invalid patterns, missing prices
- **Gate Width Snapping**: Snaps user-entered widths to available catalog widths with `snapToAvailableWidth` and `findSlidingGateRange`
- **Extended Pricing Index**: Builds bySku map for O(1) lookups, extracts available options from catalog
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provides actionable errors for missing SKUs with full context including generated SKU, selection details, and available alternatives

### Cutting List & Quote Enhancements
- **Left Panel Cutting List**: Now displays SKU, Unit Price, Total Price columns alongside Product and Quantity
- **Estimated Total**: Shows grand total with pricing at bottom of cutting list
- **Quote Export**: Line items now include SKU in description for complete product identification

### Previous Changes (November 18, 2025)

### Decking Planner Updates
- **Navigation**: Added functional "Decking" button in Product Category section that navigates from fence planner to decking planner
- **Shape Selection**: Removed square shape option, now only rectangle and semicircle available
- **Right-Click Panning**: Implemented right-click to pan functionality that works from anywhere on canvas (empty space or shapes)
- **Dynamic Shape Colors**: Shapes now preview in selected deck color instead of hardcoded blue
- **On-Canvas Dimension Editing**: Added clickable dimension labels with inline editing modal matching fence planner UX

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement.

**State Management**: Zustand with persistence middleware for application state. Two separate stores:
- `appStore.ts`: Manages fence planning state including lines, posts, gates, panels, and undo/redo history
- `deckingStore.ts`: Manages decking state including shapes, boards, selected color, and board direction

**Canvas Rendering**: Konva.js (react-konva) for high-performance 2D canvas rendering, supporting interactive drawing, zooming, panning, and real-time preview of fence and deck elements.

**Coordinate System**: All geometry stored in millimeters, converted to pixels only for rendering. SCALE_FACTOR of 10 (pixels to mm conversion). Stage transforms (scale, pan) are reversed during drag operations to maintain mm-only state invariant.

**UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable components. Design follows Microsoft Fluent Design principles emphasizing clarity and professional aesthetics.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for consistent spacing, colors, and typography. Uses Inter font for UI and JetBrains Mono for technical measurements.

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing between fence planner (`/`), decking planner (`/decking`), and drawing export views.

**Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation.

### Core Application Logic

**Fence Geometry Engine**: Custom geometry modules handle:
- Point snapping to existing fence endpoints (12px tolerance)
- 90-degree angle enforcement for orthogonal fence runs
- Post categorization (end, corner, line) based on connection angles
- Panel fitting with support for even spacing and leftover material tracking
- Gate placement validation including sliding gate return space requirements

**Decking Geometry Engine**: Custom geometry modules handle:
- Shape placement and dimension management (rectangles, semicircles)
- Board visualization with 140mm width and 3mm gaps
- Maximum board length enforcement (5400mm)
- Board direction toggling (0° or 90°)
- Shape overlap detection
- Adjacent shape snapping

**Pricing System**: Real-time cost calculation based on selected fence style, counting panels (excluding leftovers), posts by category, and gates by type. Pricing data loaded from JSON configuration.

**Warning System**: Validates design constraints and displays warnings for issues like insufficient sliding gate return space.

**History Management**: Undo/redo functionality tracking state snapshots of lines, gates, panels, and leftovers.

### Data Models

**Fence Planning Entities**:
- `FenceLine`: Represents a fence run with start/end points, length, and spacing preferences
- `Post`: Auto-generated posts categorized as end, corner, or line posts
- `Gate`: Gate placements with type-specific dimensions (single/double 900mm/1800mm, sliding 4800mm)
- `PanelSegment`: Individual fence panels with material usage tracking
- `Leftover`: Tracks reusable cut panel pieces

**Decking Planning Entities**:
- `DeckShape`: Represents deck shapes (rectangle, semicircle) with position, dimensions, and unique ID
- `Board`: Individual decking boards with position, length, and cut information
- `DeckColor`: 8 color options (Storm Granite, Mallee Bark, Ironbark Ember, Saltbush Veil, Outback, Coastal Spiniflex, Wild Shore, Coastal Sandstone)

**Type System**: Strong TypeScript typing with discriminated unions for product kinds, fence styles, gate types, deck shapes, and colors.

### Page Structure

**Fence Planner Page (`/`)**: Main workspace with three zones:
- Left panel (320px fixed width) for controls, style selection, and cost breakdown
- Top toolbar for undo/redo, clear, and navigation to drawing view
- Canvas stage (flex-grow) for interactive fence design

**Decking Planner Page (`/decking`)**: Main workspace with three zones:
- Left panel (320px fixed width) for shape selection, color picker, and board direction toggle
- Top toolbar for undo/redo, clear, and navigation
- Canvas stage (flex-grow) for interactive deck design with right-click panning and on-canvas dimension editing

**Drawing Page**: Export view showing the complete fence layout scaled to fit canvas with measurements and styling appropriate for printing/sharing.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript serving both API routes and static frontend assets.

**Development Setup**: Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement during development. Production builds serve pre-compiled static assets.

**Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer (`IStorage`) with in-memory implementation for user data. Designed to be swappable with database-backed storage.

**Session Management**: Placeholder for session handling using connect-pg-simple (PostgreSQL session store).

## External Dependencies

### Database

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`.

**Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`).

**Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations with output to `./migrations` directory.

**Note**: Database integration is scaffolded but not actively used in current fence planning features. User and session tables defined but application primarily operates client-side with local state.

### Third-Party Services

**None**: Application is fully self-contained with no external API dependencies. All pricing data, geometry calculations, and state management occur client-side.

### UI Libraries

**Component Library**: Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled component foundations.

**Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for utility-first styling.

**Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography.

### Development Tools

**Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin and custom Replit plugins for error overlay, cartographer, and dev banner in development mode.

**Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled, path aliases for clean imports (`@/`, `@shared/`, `@assets/`).

**Code Quality**: ESLint configuration (referenced but not included in repository).
